Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!
docker build .
2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.
docker run <image_id>
3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.
docker run --name <container_name> <image_id>
4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.
docker images prune
5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.
docker build -t <container_name>:<version> .
6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
docker run <image_name>
